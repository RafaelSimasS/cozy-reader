This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Introduction
I got the idea for creating this web application from a problem I had when reading PDF files on my browser. Every time I closed the book, when I opened it again, I wasn't able to continue from the page where I left off. So, I decided to create an application where I could read and resume from where I left off.

## Technologies
I used &nbsp;<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React.js-05112A?style=flat&logo=REACT" />&nbsp; and &nbsp;<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/NextJS-05112A?style=flat&logo=nextdotjs"/>&nbsp; Frameworks for building the Front-End of the application, and for the Back-End I used &nbsp;<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-05112A?style=flat&logo=NODE.JS" />&nbsp; for building and API for handling requests to a &nbsp;<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-05112A?style=flat&logo=POSTGRESQL"/>&nbsp; database.

## Status
